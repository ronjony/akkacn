# 部分HTTP框架名单

Play
====

The [Play framework](http://www.playframework.com) is built using Akka, and is well suited for building both full web applications as well as REST services.

Spray
=====

The [Spray toolkit](http://spray.io) is built using Akka, and is a minimalistic HTTP/REST layer.

Akka Mist
=========

If you are using Akka Mist (Akka's old HTTP/REST module) with Akka 1.x and wish to upgrade to 2.x
there is now a port of Akka Mist to Akka 2.x. You can find it [here](https://github.com/thenewmotion/akka-http).

Other Alternatives
==================

There are a bunch of other alternatives for using Akka with HTTP/REST. You can find some of them
among the [Community Projects](http://akka.io/community).
